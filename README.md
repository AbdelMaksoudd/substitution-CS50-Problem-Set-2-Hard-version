# substitution-CS50-Problem-Set-2-Hard-version

A command-line program written in C that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher. The user provides a 26-character key as an argument, where each letter of the alphabet is substituted with the corresponding letter from the key. The program preserves the case of letters and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged. It also validates the key to ensure it contains exactly 26 unique alphabetic characters.

Usage:

./substitution QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM
plaintext: Hello, World!
ciphertext: Itssg, Vgksr!
